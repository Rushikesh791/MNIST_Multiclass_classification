MNIST Multiclass Classification
Overview

This project is an implementation of a multiclass classification model for the MNIST dataset. MNIST is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to accurately classify these digits using various machine learning algorithms.
